Uses a **DHT22 sensor** to measure temperature and displays it on an LCD.

- **Red LED + Buzzer** → Activate when temperature ≥ 45°C (Fire Alert)  
- **Green LED** → Indicates normal temperature  
- **LCD Display** → Shows real-time temperature and status  

*Learn sensor reading, LCD output, and warning system control in Arduino.*

# 3. Car Reverse Parking Assistance System using Ultrasonic Sensor 📟🚘
To test this setup, I simulated a simple **Parking Assistance System** that detects the distance of nearby objects using an **ultrasonic sensor** and provides visual and sound alerts. 🚗📏🔊  

🔹 The **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** measures the distance between the car and an obstacle.  
🔹 The **LCD display** shows messages like “Safe Distance”, “Object Nearby”, and “Object Very Close”.  
🔹 The **Yellow LED** lights up when an object is moderately close, and the **Red LED** with **buzzer** activates when it’s too close.  
🔹 The system updates the distance on the LCD every second for real-time feedback.  

This project helped me understand how to use **ultrasonic sensors** for object detection and create **real-world safety systems** like parking assistance. ⚙️📟🚘

# 4. Smart Environment & Obstacle Detection System using DHT22 and Ultrasonic Sensor 🌡️📏🔔
To test this setup, I simulated a **Smart Monitoring System** that measures **temperature** and **distance** using the **DHT22** and **HC-SR04** sensors. 

🔹 The **DHT22 sensor** reads real-time **temperature** data and displays it on the LCD.  
🔹 The **HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor** measures the **distance** to nearby objects.  
🔹 If the **temperature exceeds 35°C**, the **red LED** turns ON and the **buzzer** alerts high temperature.  
🔹 If an **object is detected within 10 cm**, the buzzer also activates, warning about proximity.  
🔹 The **LCD** shows both **temperature** and **distance** values with clear status indicators.  

This project helped me understand how to **combine multiple sensors** for smart environmental monitoring and obstacle detection — essential for IoT and safety-based embedded systems. ⚙️🌡️📟🚨

# 5. Smart Home Security System with PIR Sensor, LCD, LED, and Buzzer 🚨🏠📟 
To test this setup, I simulated a simple **Smart Home Security System** that detects motion using a **PIR sensor** and provides **visual and sound alerts** through an **LED**, **buzzer**, and **LCD display**. 

🔹 The **PIR sensor (pin 2)** detects human motion in the monitored area.  
🔹 When **motion is detected**, the **red LED (pin 13)** lights up, the **buzzer (pin 12)** sounds, and the LCD displays **“Motion Detected”**.  
🔹 When **no motion** is detected, the system shows **“Area Secure”**, turns off the LED, and silences the buzzer.  
🔹 The LCD provides **real-time status updates** for clear user feedback.  

This project helped me understand how to **integrate multiple components** — sensors, indicators, and displays — to build a **responsive and interactive home security system** using Arduino. ⚙️🧠🔔

# 6. Maze Control Game with Joystick and Dual Servos 🎮🌀⚙️  
To test this setup, I simulated a simple **Maze Control Game** using a **joystick module** and **two servo motors** to tilt a maze platform.  

🔹 The **joystick X-axis (A0)** controls the **Servo on pin 9**, tilting the maze **left and right**.  
🔹 The **joystick Y-axis (A1)** controls the **Servo on pin 10**, tilting the maze **forward and backward**.  
🔹 Moving the joystick changes the servo angles smoothly, allowing the ball on the maze to **roll in the desired direction**.  
🔹 The project demonstrates **analog input mapping**, **servo motor control**, and **real-time movement response**.  

This project helped me understand how to **integrate analog sensors with actuators** to create a **fun and interactive Arduino-based motion control game**. ⚙️🧠🎯

# 7. Robotic Arm Control with Joystick and Dual Servos 🤖🕹️⚙️  
For this project, I built a simple **two-axis robotic arm** that is controlled using a **single joystick module**. The joystick smoothly moves two servo motors, allowing the arm to rotate and lift like a basic robotic system.

- 🔹 The **joystick X-axis (A0)** controls the **Servo on pin 9**, moving the arm **left and right**.  
- 🔹 The **joystick Y-axis (A1)** controls the **Servo on pin 10**, moving the arm **up and down**.  
- 🔹 Smooth servo motion is achieved by gradually updating the angle, giving the arm **slow and controlled movement**.  
- 🔹 The project demonstrates **analog sensor reading**, **servo angle mapping**, and **real-time motion control**.  

This project helped me understand how to **control multiple actuators using a single analog input**, creating a **simple and responsive Arduino-based robotic arm**. ⚙️🤖🎯
